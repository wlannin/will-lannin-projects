# 0 - Sudoku
Hi, here is a personal development project I did a while back to build a class in Python that can solve any Sudoku.

This project deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming, improved my coding ability, and gave me a new perspective on how different a human's strengths are to a computer's.

*Included is a bonus puzzle that I solved using similar logic to the sudoku solver. It was fun to adapt the specific logic used in the sudoku solver to a new situation.*
